The goal of this challenge was to provide a dashbord allowing the analysis of bike sale survey. 

The dashbord is done with Power Bi and can be found in this folder (as .pbix and pdf). 

Based on this dashboard, some insights and recommendation can be done. 

## Enhanced Insights

The analysis reveals significant patterns in bike ownership among different demographic groups. Young adult males (less than 30 years old)  and older males (more than 55 year old) demonstrate a higher propensity for bike ownership compared to females. However, this trend is reversed when considering middle-aged individuals (31–54 years old).

Another crucial factor influencing bike ownership is income. Buyers with higher income levels exhibit a greater likelihood of purchasing more bikes.

Additionally, the distance of daily commutes appears to play a significant role in bike ownership. Customers with shorter commutes, particularly those covering only one mile, own more bikes and typically own fewer cars, indicating a potential market for multi-bike ownership in urban areas.

Geographically, North America (43%) lags behind Pacific (59%) and Europe regions(49%) in terms of bike buyers

Marital status also impacts bike ownership trends, with married individuals purchasing fewer bikes than their single counterparts.

## Augmented Recommendations

In light of the insights gained from the analysis, it is highly advisable for bike manufacturers and retailers to tailor their marketing efforts towards middle-aged individuals (31–54 years old) who demonstrate a substantial inclination towards bike ownership. Likewise, focusing on potential customers with higher incomes presents an opportunity for increased sales, as they have been observed to be more willing to invest in multiple bikes.

Furthermore, manufacturers and retailers should consider incorporating the commuting distance factor into their marketing strategies. Customers with short daily commutes, especially those covering one mile, represent a promising target audience for encouraging multi-bike ownership.

To capitalize on the untapped potential in North America, it is imperative to implement objectives and well-defined marketing strategies. By converting non-buyers into customers, particularly in the North American region, businesses can drive substantial growth in their market share and overall revenue.

In summary, by adopting data-driven marketing approaches and paying attention to the unique characteristics of various customer segments, bike manufacturers and retailers can effectively enhance their market presence and seize new growth opportunities.
